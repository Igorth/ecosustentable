and will be used Typescript to create this app.

The version for web will be use React.JS and Typescript.

The version for mobile will be use React Native.

## Instructions

  + `brew install node --without-npm` (`npm` and Homebrew don't play well together)
  + `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh` (so, install `npm` separately)

* `git clone git@github.com/Igorth/ecosustentable`
* `cd ecosustentable server`
* `npm` to install dependencies
* `npm start dev` to start the project
